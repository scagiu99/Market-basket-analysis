# Market-basket-analysis
Project for the University Master Degree Course of Algorithms for Massive Datasets.

This project aims to perform a Market Basket Analysis from scratch using the Apriori algorithm. By analyzing customer transaction data from the [Yelp dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yelp-dataset/yelp-dataset), the goal is to identify frequent itemsets and derive association rules that can provide valuable insights into purchasing behaviors.
